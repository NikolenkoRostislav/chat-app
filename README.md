## Introduction

Chat App is a simple messaging web app built with Python (FastAPI + SQLAlchemy) for the backend and React + TypeScript for the frontend.
It allows users to create accounts, join chats, and send messages in a clean and user-friendly interface.

This project was made as part of my learning process for fullstack development, focusing on authentication, database relations, and frontendâ€“backend communication. Future versions may include features like sockets for live updates and improved chatroom management.
